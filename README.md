# KickstarterAnalysis
Performing analysis on Kickstart data to uncover trends.

### **Project Overview**

- **Deliverable 1**

- - The start of this section was to get all of the necessary information in order to create a proper pivot table. 
- - I changed the years column to the correct formatting, in order to determine when the kickstarter fundraiser began.
- - Once I had the necessary information that was needed, I created a pivot table to show how many fundraisers had failed, were successful, or got canceled based on a given month.
- - Since I was only wanting to look at theater, I filtered out the parent category to only show theater kickstarter fundraisers. 
- - Using the desired pivot, I created a line chart to help visualize the trends that were happening. 

- **Deliverable 2**

- - Now that I have a general basis on kickstarter fundraisers in a given month for theater, I need to narrow it down more to get a deeper dive into it.
- - I created a new sheet, and and columns in order to get the percentage of failed, successful, or canceled projects based on a certain goal range for plays.
- - I used a COUNTIFS function in order to get that information. 
- - Once the goals for the subcategory of plays was properly added, I created a pivot table, filtered that pivot table accordingly, and created another line graph to help visualize what was happening.

### **Challenges and Results**

- **Challenges**

- - My Challenges

- - - The biggest challenge for me was that I was referencing the pictures that were given to cross reference if my information was correct.
- - - Deliverable 2's image was a bit different from mine, so I decided to use the slack AskBCS thread for help. 
- - - When I was sending my information over, I realized that I was actually correct, and the graph may be a bit different than mine.

- - Potential Challenges
- - - While throughout this project I necessarily didn't run into to many issues, I do see where some people might get tripped up.
- - - If someone has never used any ifs function before, the countifs portion of deliverables 2 could be trickly and cause headaches for some people.
- - - Another potential challenge would be writing an analysis on results. Getting results is one thing, but learning to analyze those results properly is another.

- **Results**
- - Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date First Conclusion
- - - The first thing I noticed was that mid April through mid July, there were over 80 successful fundraisers span of time, peaking in May.
- - - One of the reasons that this might be is that this is the time that summer is coming, and kids are getting out of school. With kids getting out of school, they will need activities to do and go to.

- - Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date Second Conclusion
- - - In December the number of failed outcomes almost equaled the number of successful outcomes.
- - - One of the reasons this might be is that Christmas is coming up, and people are less likely to spend money on unesseccary things.

- - Outcomes Vs Goals First Conclusion
- - - I noticed that the percentage of successful and percentage of failed results had an inverse relationship.
- - - The graphs look almost identical, with them peaking at the same exact time. 
- - - The reason that I believe this is the case is due to the fact that when kickstarter fundraisers are becoming more successful, there are less ones that are failing, and vise versa.

- **Summary of Limitations**
- - Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- - - While the pivot tables and graphs are great, it could also be improved. it doesn't show enough information, and isn't compared to anything else.
- - - The Theater and Outcomes Based on Launch Date should include previous years as well, to see how the given year is doing. It could be that the peak in May is an outlier, and it normally peaks in October.
- - - This graph unfortunately does not allow us to see if that is the case or not.
- - Outcomes Vs Goals
- - - This graph is a great representation to show the inverse relationship between successful and failed fundraisers, this can be improved as well.
- - - This could be compared to other subcategories in theater, or even compare to theater as a whole to see how it is doing. 
- - - If compared to theater as whole, it could show if it is doing better, worse, or the same as all of theater.
